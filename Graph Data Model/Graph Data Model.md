# GDM (Graph Data Model)
The Graph Data Model is made up of four parts: Vertices, Edges, Operations, and Types.


# Labeling
**Labels** are the most important as they dictate the core semantics of the OGraph protocol.

Defined Labels:

- **Vertex/Node Label**
- **Edge/Link Label**
- **Operation Label**
- **Model/Domain Label**
